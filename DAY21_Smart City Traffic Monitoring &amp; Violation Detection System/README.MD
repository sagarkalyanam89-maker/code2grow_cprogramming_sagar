This challenge is about creating a traffic monitoring and violation detection system using basic C programming concepts. The system handles data for up to 30 vehicles, taking inputs like Vehicle ID, Speed, and Lane Number using numeric values only.
It identifies speed violations if the speed exceeds 80 km/h, and detects lane violations using the rule:
VehicleID % 4 != lane.
It also performs traffic density analysis by counting vehicles in each lane and determining the busiest and least busy lanes.
Finally, it displays a detailed traffic report including violations, and a summary showing totals and highest/lowest values.
