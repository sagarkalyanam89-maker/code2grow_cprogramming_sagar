This challenge involves creating a Student Attendance & Performance Matrix System using 2D arrays, loops, and switch-case. 
The program handles attendance (1/0), marks (0–100), and student names for 5 students. It calculates total presents, absences, total marks, averages, highest and lowest performers, and assigns grades.
A menu-driven system allows users to display attendance, marks, attendance reports, performance reports, and grade reports until the user chooses to exit.
The solution uses only arrays, loops, and conditional statements without functions or structures.
