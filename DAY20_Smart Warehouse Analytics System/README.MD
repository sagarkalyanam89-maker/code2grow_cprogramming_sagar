This project is a function-based C program designed to manage warehouse product data.

It stores up to 20 products using numeric-only 1D arrays for ID, Quantity, and Price.

The system is fully menu-driven and allows users to add, search, and update product details.

Duplicate product IDs are prevented, and all entries are validated for positive values.

A 3×3 rack matrix is processed to find maximum, minimum, and total stock.

The program calculates stock value for each product using Quantity × Price.

It identifies products with the highest and lowest stock values.

Total warehouse stock value is computed and displayed.

A formatted table shows all stored product records for easy viewing.

The project demonstrates strong use of functions, arrays, loops, and modular programming.
