This challenge asks you to create a simple Inventory Management System using only arrays, loops, and conditional statements—no 
functions or structures allowed. The system must store details for up to 10 products, including product ID, name, quantity, and price. 
It should display all products, calculate the total inventory value, identify the product with the highest and lowest value, and allow searching for
a product by its ID. The program must be menu-driven, meaning it keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
